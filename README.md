# Volume Control With Hand Detection OpenCV Python


The Volume Control With Hand Detection OpenCV Python was developed using Python OpenCV, In this Python OpenCV Project With Source Code we are going Building a Volume Controller with OpenCV , To change the volume of a computer.

We first look into hand tracking and then we will use the hand landmarks to find gesture of our hand to change the volume. This project is module based which means we will be using a previously created hand module which makes the hand tracking very easy.
